  # Create Real Salesperson Profile

  1. New Profile
    - Create a real salesperson profile with the ID that clients are referencing
    - Set proper role as 'asesor_ventas'
    - Add realistic contact information

  2. Data Integrity
    - This will fix the broken foreign key references
    - Orders will now show the correct salesperson name
